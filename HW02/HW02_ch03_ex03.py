# This exercise can be done using only the statements and other features we 
# have learned so far.

# (1) Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
# + - - - - + - - - - +
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# + - - - - + - - - - +
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# |         |         |
# + - - - - + - - - - +

# Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a 
# comma-separated sequence of values:

# print('+', '-')

# By default, print advances to the next line, but you can 
# override that behavior and put a space at the end, like this:

# print('+', end=' ')
# print('-')

# The output of these statements is '+ -'.

# A print statement with no argument ends the current line and 
# goes to the next line.



# (2) Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.

# Write your functions below:

def do_twice(f):
	f()
	f()

def do_four(f):
	do_twice(f)
	do_twice(f)

def print_border():
	print('+ - - - - + - - - - +')

def print_inside():
	print('|         |         |')

def print_grid():
	print_border()
	do_four(print_inside)
	print_border()
	do_four(print_inside)
	print_border()

print_grid()










# Write your functions above:
